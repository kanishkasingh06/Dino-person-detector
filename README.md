# Dino-person-detector
This project utilizes the DINO object detection model for pedestrian detection, implemented in Google Colab.

Steps to Run the Code
1. Prepare the Dataset and Annotations
2. Place the zip file containing the images and the .json file with annotations into the content/ folder of your Colab environment.

Download Pre-trained Weights
Download the pre-trained weights file checkpoint0011_4scale.pth from this link.
Add the weights file to the content/dino/ folder.
Run the Model in Google Colab

Open and run the Model.ipynb notebook in Google Colab. The notebook is designed to work within the Colab environment.
The code includes steps to unzip the images and copy them to the appropriate directories automatically.
By following these steps, you should be able to fine-tune and run the DINO model for pedestrian detection on your custom dataset.
